## Aerial Building MVS Dataset
Download Link: [Baidu NetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1me2lrSkskNiveJGMOJu5JQ?pwd=mufv)

Due to the limitation of uploading size, we have split the dataset.zip into four files by the below command:
```
split -b 3072mb MVS_Aerial_Building.zip MVS_Aerial_Building_ 
```

The overall zip file can be merged by the following command:
```
cat MVS_Aerial_Building_* > MVS_Aerial_Building.zip
```

## Code
We will release our code soon.
